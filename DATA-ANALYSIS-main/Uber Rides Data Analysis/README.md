This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber rides to uncover trends and insights related to ride timings, frequency, and usage patterns across different categories and purposes.

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash 
UberRides_DA/
├── UberRides_DA.ipynb # Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis
├── README.md # Project overview and usage instructions
└── (Optional) figures/ # Directory for storing output plots/images
```


## 🔍 Objective

The objective of this analysis is to:

- Understand how Uber is being used across different times of the day.
- Examine ride purposes and categories.
- Visualize usage patterns over time.
- Derive business insights that can help optimize operations and marketing efforts.

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Distribution of rides by category and purpose.
- Analysis of rides over day vs night.
